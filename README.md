# react-express-map-app

To run webpack and update the JS files from the src to dist type 'webpack'.
To run webpack and keep it looking for updates type 'webpack --watch'.

The boot up you currently need to run 'webpack-dev-server'.

Need to:
- Setup the gulpfile to run with gulp build or gulp dev
- Setup webpack to only run the js commands when the gulp command is run instead
    - (e.g. gulp reuns webpack for us along with webpack --watch and webpack-dev-server)
